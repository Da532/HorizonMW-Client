# Introduction

This version of HorizonMW's source code, has been specifically designed for WINE, running from Linux. Please do not attempt to run anywhere outside of a Linux OS.

For pre-compiled WINE-compliant binaries (to be run inside of Linux only) please see the [releases](https://github.com/MichaelDeets/HorizonMW-Client/releases) for more information.

For a guide on what depedencies are required, that is coming soon...

## Installation

Download `h2m-mod.exe` from [releases](https://github.com/MichaelDeets/HorizonMW-Client/releases), place this file inside your HorizonMW root directory.

Note: Using HMW Launcher to verify the files will replace `h2m-mod.exe` with the original copy (that doesn't work in Linux). If you use HMW Launcher to verify files, make sure to re-replace the `h2m-mod.exe` file inside the root directory.

## Bugs / Issues

Please report any issues you have with running `h2m-mod.exe` through WINE/Linux. If you have problems unrelated to WINE/Linux, instead use the original [HorizonMW GitHub](https://github.com/HorizonMW/HorizonMW-Client).

## Game not launching

1: Try running `h2m-mod.exe` from Steam (add a non-Steam game), using Proton Experimental or Proton GE.

2: Try adding `-nosteam` as a launch option.
